BUILDING SIGAR
--------------
https://support.hyperic.com/display/SIGAR/Home
install JDK >= 1.4, Ant >= 1.6.5, Perl >= 5.6.1 (I used Strawberry), Visual Studio 2015, Windows SDK

Set up command prompt environment
---------------------------------
Set JAVA_HOME and ANT_HOME variables in your Windows system. Add JAVA_HOME to your %PATH% variable.
REMOVE the entry in your PATH variable which your Perl install may have put there, which has gcc.exe in it. We want to force the use of cl.exe
add the location of rc.exe, which comes with Windows SDK, into PATH 
run "vcvarsall.bat amd64" to configure cl.exe to target x64 architecture
go to "{sigar-root}\bindings\java\" and run "ant" command

I already changed two calls to wcstok() in eventlog.c, to use the third argument specified here: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/wcstok.3.html
 it only had 2 args before due to using an older library
 
eventlog.c win32_set_pointer() seems to assume that pointers are the same size as ints.. this is a problem on 64-bit machines. But no java class in the library
 appears to actually call the EventLog java class, outside of main() functions which shouldn't be run... so this shouldn't run normally unless we explicitly call it.
 Let's pray this doesn't cause a crash. Boo on this code
 
I took the lazy approach of adding these three lines to sigar.h:
#ifndef __64BIT__
#define __64BIT__
#endif
	instead of trying to figure out how to pass in environment variables through Ant. This should fix the 64-bit pointer bug described here:
	https://communities.vmware.com/message/2121479#2121479
	I pray that no other similar pointer bugs cause crashes. If they do, they should also cause EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION errors.
